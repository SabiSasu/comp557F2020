For assignment 4, I only completed objectives 1 to 10 without extra features. 

Here are the xml/image pairs for each completed objectives, with some explanations for the novel scene

Objective 2-3: Sphere.xml/Sphere.png
Objective 4: Plane.xml/Plane.png & Plane2.xml/Plane2.png
Objective 5: TwoSpheresPlane.xml/TwoSpheresPlane.png 
Objective 6: BoxRGBLights.xml/BoxRGBLights.png 
Objective 7: BoxStacks.xml/BoxStacks.png 
Objective 9: TorusMesh.xml/TorusMesh.png 

Objective 8: AACheckerPlane.xml/AACheckerPlane.png 
I added the jitter boolean in Render as an attribute and read it in Parser, it is false by default. Anti-aliasing is done using uniform grid super sampling.

Objective 10: myScene.xml/myScene.png
I made a simple scene regrouping the different objects implemented, namely the torus mesh, spheres, planes and cubes.
I used 2 cubes for the walls, defined different lights, of which 2 are colored and gave different colors, specular strength and hardness to materials.
