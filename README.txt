My character is called Bob, he's a chubby orange cat standing up on his hind legs. He's wearing a lilac shirt and jeans, striking a cowboy pose.
He has 2 long human looking arms and a long neck that wobbles left to right as he moves (inspired by the monster hunter wiggle head helmet).
I have to admit that it looked way better on paper than what I made for this assignement but I think it has some charm nonetheless...

There are 3 lights in the scene, two are on the right slightly in front of the character and one is upper left. 
They all have different specular strengths to try to make it look dynamic.

My implementation follows closely the instructions, however I added some more settings for some of the joints and geoms.
For instance, the geoms can have their rgb colors set in the xml file.
The spherical joints can have their angular min and max defined as well as an initial rotation (which i end up not using but it's there).

In the video, Bob is doing some cowboy dances (he loves cowboy movies) in a seemless loop.
I captured the animation using OBS, which I slightly slowed down in Video Editor to x0.8 speed.
